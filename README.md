Here are the set of things that need to be resolved for the site:
 -  Follow design guide / spacings / CSS from zepelin. Go to <A HREF="https://app.zepelin.io">app.zepelin.io</A> and sign up with @zambezi; then 
 -  You will then see an ABC project shared with you by denise. If you don't see this, ping Denise or me, and I'll see what I can fix for you.
 -  Let's update the CSS to reflect what's in that site. I tried to update it in the index.html just to try -- I suspect it needs to be split into a separate look-and-feel.css and included neatly. Denise said something about bootstrap and alignment - I think I didn't make that work that well.
 -  Responsive design / site look and feel in mobile browser is pretty grim - again, I suspect this is something due to my shortcomings in hacking it around - but we need to make this cleaner.
 - Fonts - we use 'Fira Sans' as the Sans Serif; it's a google font and i updated index with a font reference to pull it in and test it.
 
 ** Refactors **
 
 - I think we need to refactor to:
 -- split out the css into separate little CSS library
 -- shorten the text so that it's uniform
